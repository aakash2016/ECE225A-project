            The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle based on a game show. Imagine there are three doors:
            - Behind one door is a <strong>car</strong> (the prize you want to win üöó).
            - Behind the other two doors are <strong>goats</strong> (not the prize üêê).  
            </p>
            <p style='font-size: 14px; color: #2C3E50;'>
            Here's how it works:
            1. You make an initial choice by selecting one of the three doors. üö™
            2. The host, Monty Hall (who knows what's behind each door), opens another door, revealing a goat. üêê
            3. You now have two options: 
                - <strong>Stick</strong> with your original choice.
                - <strong>Switch</strong> to the other unopened door.  
            </p>
            <p style='font-size: 14px; color: #2C3E50;'>
            <strong>üß† The Probability Insight</strong>
            - If you <strong>stick</strong> with your original choice, your probability of winning the car remains <strong>1/3</strong> (since you had a 1 in 3 chance initially).
            - If you <strong>switch</strong>, your probability of winning becomes <strong>2/3</strong>. Why? When Monty opens a door to reveal a goat, he provides additional information, effectively doubling your odds of winning by switching!
            </p>
            <p style='font-size: 14px; color: #2C3E50;'>
            This simulator lets you test these probabilities by simulating multiple rounds of the game. 
            Observe how switching consistently gives you better odds over many iterations. üé≤‚ú®
